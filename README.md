Hello! In this repository, I store the links to articles in the tech world I find interesting. Each article is accompanied by a short abstract I wrote after reading it.

The topics are generally futuristic and range from ***AI, Autonomous Vehicles, Social Media, Crypto/Web3/NFTs, Metaverse/AR/VR, Robotics, Space Exploration, Internet-of-Things, Quantum Computing, Tech Startups, Electric Vehicles, Cleantech, Big Tech and other disruptive technologies*.**

**Disclaimer:** *I acknowledge that some topics are strongly related to each other (e.g. Social Media, Metaverse & Big Tech) and some articles can be relevant to multiple topics/sub-topics. Nevertheless, the topic categorization reflects my sense of which ideas stick out often enough (from what i read/watch online) to be its own 'topic' and my choice of topic/sub-topic per article reflects my sense of which topic/sub-topic represents it the best.*

## Artificial Intelligence

### AI Consciousness

>  #### [Google’s ‘Sentient’ Chatbot Is Our Self-Deceiving Future](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/06/google-engineer-sentient-ai-chatbot/661273/). *(By [Ian Bogost](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/), The Atlantic, 15th June 2022)* 
>  Instead of rebuking Blake Lemoine for making false claims about Google's LaMDA being sentient, Ian dives into the psychological reasons why humans are so easily fooled into categorizing computer programs as sentient. 

### AI Ethics and Regulation

>  #### [Why You Need an AI Ethics Committee](https://hbr.org/2022/07/why-you-need-an-ai-ethics-committee). *(By [Reid Blackman](https://www.reidblackman.com/about/), Harvard Business Review, Jul-Aug 2022 Issue)*
>  Reid identifies the ways in which ethical problems can arise in AI products, how it can be detrimental to a business and proposes the makeup of an AI ethics committee in a corporation along with their specific roles and duties. These roles include ethics experts, technologists, business strategists, lawyers and bias scouts.

>  #### [An AI Company Scraped Billions of Photos For Facial Recognition. Regulators Can't Stop It](https://time.com/6182177/clearview-ai-regulators-uk/). *(By [Billy Perrigo](https://time.com/author/billy-perrigo/), TIME, 27th May 2022)*
>  Billy reports on the increasing fines, winning lawsuits and resistance against Clearview AI, a controversial facial recognition company with a web-scraped database of 20 billion images. However, Clearview AI does not have to comply with fines outside the US as there is no international agreement. A lack of federal privacy regulations in the US also means that their power is kept untamed.

### AI History and Philosophy


>  #### [AI’s first philosopher](https://aeon.co/essays/why-we-should-remember-alan-turing-as-a-philosopher). *(By [Sebastian Sunday Grève](https://www.yhposolihp.com/), Aeon, 21st Apr 2022)*
>  Sebastian writes a long essay detailing the historical accounts of Alan Turing's work on intelligent machinery. He posits that his work had the aim of conceptual clarity and not on operationalizing intelligence itself. He also explains why the Turing Test/Imitation Game is widely misunderstood by many.

## Crypto-Web3-NFTs

### Making sense of Web3 and NFTs

>  #### [The Internet Is Just Investment Banking Now](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/02/future-internet-blockchain-investment-banking/621480/). *(By [Ian Bogost](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/), The Atlantic, 5th Feb 2022)*
>  While acknowledging the common ridicule of NFTs, Ian composes an understanding of why people take them seriously, hence why they work. He also proposes that Web3 is merely but an explicit expression of how our digital lives are already commodified for the sake of profits.

### The NFT World

>  #### [How Gary Vaynerchuk Became an NFT Guru](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/gary-vaynerchuk-nft.html). *(By [Benjamin Wallace](https://nymag.com/author/benjamin-wallace/), New York Magazine, 16th Nov 2021)*
>  Benjamin describes the phenomenon of Gary Vee and how he has managed to amass an empire of NFT devouts. This is a rather biographical piece that attempts to peek into the mind of Gary Vee and how he has come to this point.


## Metaverse-AR-VR

### Concerns about the Metaverse

>  #### [The metaverse has a groping problem already](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/16/1042516/the-metaverse-has-a-groping-problem/). *(By [Tanya Basu](https://www.technologyreview.com/author/tanya-basu/), MIT Technology Review, 16th Dec 2021)*
>  Tanya brings to attention, the issue of sexual harassment in the Metaverse. She discusses specific examples, the validity of such virtual claims as well as how Metaverse-builders can make have a more direct method of stopping harassment instead of delineating the responsibility of prevention to users.

>  #### [The metaverse is the next venue for body dysmorphia online](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/11/16/1040174/facebook-metaverse-body-dysmorphia/). *(By [Tanya Basu](https://www.technologyreview.com/author/tanya-basu/), MIT Technology Review, 16th Nov 2021)*
>  Of the many novel aspects of the Metaverse, Tanya brings to light the issue of body image problems from metaverse avatars. She highlights how accurate third-person view avatars of oneself can worsen body image issues and how inaccurate avatars may perpetuate unattainable standards of beauty.

### Possibilities of the Metaverse

>  #### [Can humanity be recreated in the metaverse?](https://venturebeat.com/2022/06/18/can-humanity-be-recreated-in-the-metaverse/?__vfz=medium%3Dstandalone_content_recirculation_with_ads). *(By [Tom Graham](https://venturebeat.com/author/tom-graham/), VentureBeat, 18th Jun 2022)*
>  Tom explains the concept of hyperreality and how it blurs the line between reality and virtual tools. He expresses an optimistic view of how generative AI can be used to design a hyperreal metaverse in the next decade, one that extends beyond gaming and entertainment.

## Social Media

### Free Speech and Content Moderation

>  #### [How to Fix Twitter—And All of Social Media](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/05/how-to-fix-twitter-social-media/629951/). *(By [Jaron Lanier](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/jaron-lanier/), The Atlantic, 26th May 2022)*
>  Jaron brings up the supposed dichotomy between free speech and content moderation on social media while contending for a middle ground. He proposes the idea of 'group formation via association' in respect of 'digital dignity', where users explicitly form small groups for content sharing and self-moderation. Personally, it just sounds like a Reddit with a member count cap per subreddit. 

>  #### [Running Twitter Is Going to Disappoint Elon Musk](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech/629673/). *(By [Evelyn Douek](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/evelyn-douek/), The Atlantic, 26th Apr 2022)*
>  Evelyn sends Elon Muck a reality-check by claiming it is unrealistic to get rid of moderation on social media platforms like Twitter without serious harm. However she supports Elon's goal in making Twitter's moderation algorithms open-source and transparent.

>  #### [More Content Moderation Is Not Always Better ](https://www.wired.com/story/more-content-moderation-not-always-better/). *(By [Evelyn Douek](https://www.wired.com/author/evelyn-douek/), Wired, 2nd Jun 2021)*
>  While she agrees that content moderation has done more good than harm, Evelyn reminds us that we should not take their trade-offs for granted. With imperfect moderation, disproportionate power to a few Silicon Valley executives and geopolitical consequences, she posits that we should not blindly accept content moderation and seek to find a middle ground tech-based solutions.
