## Artificial Intelligence

### AI Consciousness

>  #### [Google’s ‘Sentient’ Chatbot Is Our Self-Deceiving Future](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/06/google-engineer-sentient-ai-chatbot/661273/). *(By [Ian Bogost](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/), The Atlantic, 15th June 2022)* 
>  Instead of rebuking Blake Lemoine for making false claims about Google LaMDA being sentient, Ian dives into the psychological reasons why humans are so easily fooled into categorizing computer programs as sentient. 

### AI Ethics

>  #### [Why You Need an AI Ethics Committee](https://hbr.org/2022/07/why-you-need-an-ai-ethics-committee). *(By [Reid Blackman](https://www.reidblackman.com/about/), Harvard Business Review, Jul-Aug 2022 Issue)*
>  Reid identifies the ways in which ethical problems can arise in AI products, how it can be detrimental to a business and proposes the makeup of an AI ethics committee in a corporation along with their specific roles and duties. These roles include ethics experts, technologists, business strategists, lawyers and bias scouts.

## Crypto-Web3-NFTs

### Making sense of Web3 and NFTs

>  #### [The Internet Is Just Investment Banking Now](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/02/future-internet-blockchain-investment-banking/621480/). *(By [Ian Bogost](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/), The Atlantic, 5th Feb 2022)*
>  While acknowledging the common ridicule of NFTs, Ian composes an understanding of why people take them seriously, hence why they work. He also proposes that Web3 is merely but an explicit expression of how our digital lives are already commodified for the sake of profits.

## Social Media

### Free Speech and Content Moderation

>  #### [How to Fix Twitter—And All of Social Media](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/05/how-to-fix-twitter-social-media/629951/). *(By [Jaron Lanier](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/jaron-lanier/), The Atlantic, 26th May 2022)*
>  Jaron brings up the supposed dichotomy between free speech and content moderation on social media while contending for a middle ground. He proposes the idea of 'group formation via association' in respect of 'digital dignity', where users explicitly form small groups for content sharing and self-moderation. Personally, it just sounds like a Reddit with a member count cap per subreddit. 

>  #### [Running Twitter Is Going to Disappoint Elon Musk](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/elon-musk-twitter-free-speech/629673/). *(By [Evelyn Douek](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/evelyn-douek/), The Atlantic, 26th Apr 2022)*
>  Evelyn sends Elon Muck a reality-check by claiming it is unrealistic to get rid of moderation on social media platforms like Twitter without serious harm. However she supports Elon's goal in making Twitter's moderation algorithms open-source and transparent.
